team activity week 3

Hi there! My name is Matthew James
    I love to make sushi, eat food, and play music. Hopefully, I can be in choir next semester. I love coding, and am super excited to learn more and become a better software devoloper. Hopefully one day, I can learn to make some amazing things.
