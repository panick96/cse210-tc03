team activity week 3

Hi I'm Nick

I am 25 years old. I just got married in August 2020

I have lived in 11 states and hope to make it more.

I love hiking, video games, and going to concerts. 

I also love movies and comedy. I love to look at the editing, cinematography, and special effects especially. 

I hope to graduate in April 2022.
